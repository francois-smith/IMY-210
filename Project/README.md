## About The Project

This Project is built using Vue.js as front end with a RESTful server supporting the backend. 

Data is stored using XML and is validated using a global XML Schema file. The restful server allows the usage of basic CRUD commands.

<br/>

## Usage

Use github's download feature to download a .zip of the code.

Once you have the files installed you can extract them to a location of you choice. Once the files are extracted open the RESTful folder in CMD, or your code editor of choices' terminal.

Run the following commands to activate your server:

- Installing dependencies (make user you have Node.js installed)
```
  npm install
```
- Running the server (server will default to port: 3000)
```
  node server.js
```

Once your server is up and running navigate one folder back and locate the VUE folder, also open this folder in CMD and run the install command once again to get necessary packages.

After installing the packages you can run the final command:
- Starting the Vue client (server will default to port: 8080)
```
  npm run serve
```

This will start a client on port: 8080, you can navigate to your browser and enter localhost:8080. This will open up the web client and you can now use the scheduling application.

## Features

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: -10px">Phase 1</h2>
</div>

### File Validation
- All XML files storing containing schedules are validated with a universal .dtd file, this file is robust to detect errors in XML files and keep a unified structure to all schedule files.
 
### Displaying Information
- Each schedule can be exported using a .xslt, this file is data agnostic so it will work with any schedule.

### Calendar publishing
- Included is a XSL-FO file that can be used to convert a schedule to pdf for easy publishing, using XSL-FO documents will not be discussed in this README, but you can read more of it <a href="https://www.antenna.co.jp/XML/downfree/howto1023/howtodevelop-en1025.pdf">here</a>

### RESTful Server
- The server provides an interface to perform CRUD events on XML files. These commands are hidden from the user and rather provides an easy to use interface to communicate with the server and manipulate data.
- The server includes GET, POST, DELETE and PUT commands, examples of requests made with these commands are listed below.
     
- GET
    - There are 2 versions of GET.
    - The fist type is to request an entire schedule object of a specific user. An example body looks as follows:
        ```
            {
                "userName": "ExampleUser" //required
            }
        ```
        This will fetch the file associated with the specified user, it also returns error message if user does not exist or file could not be found.   
    - The second type searches for an event with a specific ID within a user's schedule file. An example body looks as follows: 
        ```
            {
                "userName": "ExampleUser", //required
                "eventId": "EVT123456" //required
            }
        ```
        This will fetch the file associated with the specified user and search through all events saved in this file for the eventID, if the ID does not exist within the file then a relevant error is returned. It also returns an error message if user does not exist or file could not be found.  

- POST
    - There is a single POST command.
    - The POST request lightly asumes that the data that is sent from the client side is correct. The server still does a lot of error checking to adhere to the XML Schema and if a certain field does not adhere to the rules then a relevant error is returned.
    - POST takes in a user and event, the user is used to determine what schedule to add the event to. The event is a structured JSON object that is compiled on the client side when request is made.
    - An example request looks as follows:
        ```
            {
                "userName": "ExampleUser", //required
                "event": { 
                    "id": "EVT123456", //required
                    "title": "Example", //required
                    "type": "Task", //required
                    "date": {
                        "repeat": "Daily", //optional
                        "day": 4, //required
                        "month": "January", //required
                        "startingTime": "03:30 PM", //optional
                        "endingTime": "04:30 PM" //optional
                    },
                    "guests":[ //required
                        {
                            "guest":[ //optional, max 10 entries
                                { //each guest must contain at least a name or title
                                    "name": ["yeet"], //optional
                                    "email": ["yeet"] //optional
                                },
                                {
                                    "name": ["yeet"], //optional
                                    "email": ["yeet"] //optional
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ],
                    "venue": "Example", //optional
                    "description": "Example" //optional
                } 
            }
        ```
- PUT
    - There is a single PUT command.
    - POST takes in a user and update event, the user is used to determine what schedule to update the event in. The updated event is validated on server side and relevent error are returned.
    - An example request looks as follows:
        ```
            {
                "userName": "ExampleUser", //required
                "updatedEvent": { 
                    "id": "EVT123456", //required
                    "title": "Example", //required
                    "type": "Task", //required
                    "date": {
                        "repeat": "Daily", //optional
                        "day": 4, //required
                        "month": "January", //required
                        "startingTime": "03:30 PM", //optional
                        "endingTime": "04:30 PM" //optional
                    },
                    "guests":[ //required
                        {
                            "guest":[ //optional, max 10 entries
                                { //each guest must contain at least a name or title
                                    "name": ["yeet"], //optional
                                    "email": ["yeet"] //optional
                                },
                                {
                                    "name": ["yeet"], //optional
                                    "email": ["yeet"] //optional
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ],
                    "venue": "Example", //optional
                    "description": "Example" //optional
                } 
            }
        ```

- DELETE
    - There is a single DELETE command. This will load the file associated with the inputed user, if no event is found with the passed in ID then an error is returned.  
        ```
            {
                "userName": "ExampleUser", //required
                "eventId": "EVT123456" //required
            }
        ```
        It will return the new JSON object of the schedule after delete to allow the calendar on the clientside to be updated.

### Application
- The frontend of the client is built using Vue.js. Data is recieved from server then populated accordingly.
- Some features:
    - User schedules can be selected from a list of calendars, if current user is the owner of schedule then all CRUD functionality can be used to manipulate the data.
    - If a user opens a schedule that is not owned by them they can still view the data but they cannot perform CRUD events.

### Interacting With The Data
- Using the client, function communicate with the RESTful server to perform CRUD events on thier respective schedules.
